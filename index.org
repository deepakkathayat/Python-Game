* Code Organisation
There are five files in total,each containing one or more classes,corresponding to different objects used in the game.

* Code Decomposition
There are in total twelve classes.Nine of them are classes for specific objects of the game, and the remaing are for implementing those classes and their methods.
What follow are the descriptions of each file and the classes implemented in each of them along with the class methods.

* 201101213-robot.py

  This file contains the main function, which runs the game.
  It has the following methods:
** curses.wrapper
   Initializes curses and calls another callable object, main(), which handles the rest of my curses-using application.

** main()
   Takes in the screen/window object argument. 
   This function runs the active game loop.
   The game loop has its set of instructions,which includes handling the keys,check conditions for robot collisions,check conditions for Game success/failure and time-keeping instructions.
   The 'gameset' is a list of game level objects which are created using the 'Game' class imported from 'game.py'.

** set-level()
   It initialises the variables of game level objects,depending on the PLAY MODE chosen by the player.
   
** do-pause()
   Function to pause the game.

** show-explosion()
   Function which initialises the explosion of Bombs and Mines.

** level-specific-property()
   Function which contains check conditions specific to each level.
   
   
* game.py
  Encapsulates the game state.
  It imports all the classes from all the game files.
  
** class Game
  Wraps up all the game state information for the functioning of the active game.
  Contains the following functions:
  
*** --init--()
    Initialises all the game state variables and objects.

*** -makeCD()
    Initialises the 'codes' object,'mines' object,'enemy' object.
    Also calls the function to print the level information at the beginning of each level.

*** print-level-info()
    Prints the level information of each level before the corresponding level starts.

*** tick()
    It tells all the game objects to update themselves at every instance of the game.

*** draw()
    The most important of all,it draws the game screen at every instance of the game.Called from the main function.
    
*** handle-key()
    Handles the key presses of the player for the robot object.

*** add-object()
    Adds the game object to the gameobject list.

*** check-for-hit()
    Checks whether the game object has been hit or not.

*** remove-dead-objects()
    Removes objects that are to be removed off the screen.

*** tickcount()
    Returns the tickcount of the game.

*** over()
    Check if the robot has been destroyed.

*** -draw-panel,-draw-time,-draw-score,-draw-shield,-draw-info
    Draws the panel,time,score,shield,information of the game.

*** game-over(),center()
    Draws the 'game over message' on the screen in the end of game.

** class Level
   Contains functions which initialise objects pertaining to a particular level.
   

* gameobject.py
  Implements Gameobjects of the game and calls all their methods.
  
** class Gameobject
   Base class for most of the game elements in the game and includes methods for being updated and drawn.
   Contains the following functions:

*** --init--()
   Initialises the gameobject variables.

*** draw()
   Draws the game object at its current location.
   The colour and other attributes an object is drawn in is determined by the value returned by -drawing-attributes();
   derived classes can overide this.
   The routine is also careful to make sure nothing is drawn off screen.
*** -draw-normal-object()
    Implements drawing for an object in its normal state.
*** -draw-exploding-object()
    Implements drawing for an object in its exploding state.
*** -draw-object-line()
    Draws one line for a shape of the object.
*** -drawing-attribs()
    Curses attributes to be used when drawing. Derived classes will override this.
*** tick()
    Used to update the object because of passing time.
    Deriived classes will override it.
*** is-alive()
    Derived classes will override it.
*** handle-possible-hit()
    Checks if the object has been hit.
    Derived objects should (as appropriate) check if they include the specified x, y coordinates and are therefore hit.
    If they are,they should update themselves according to the damage value.The result of the update could be damaged or destroyed.
    Derived classes will override it.
*** play-width()
    Returns width of the game screen.
*** explosion-duration()
    Returns the gametime at which the explosion animation for the object ends.
    

* robot.py
  Contains classes of Robot,Bullet and AutoPilot object.

** class Bullet
   Inherits the Gameobject class.
   Represents the bullet from the player's Robot.
   Contains the following functions:
   
*** --init--()
    Initialises the co-ordinates and shape of the Bullet object.
     
*** -drawing-attribs()
    Returns the drawing attributes of the Bullet object.
*** tick()
    Tells the bullet that the game has moved on in time.
*** is-alive()
    Returns whether or not the object is to be deleted.

** class Robot
   Represents the player's robot.Handled in many ways like any other game object in that it has a draw method,
   knows its co-ordinates etc. However it is different in that it takes keyboard input (done by Game knowing about this
   object directly, as well as through its game object list) rather than being driven by tick().
   Also generates bullets.
   Contains the following functions:
   
*** --init--()
    Initialises the Robot co-ordinates,shape,play area,initial direction movement.
*** -drawing-attribs()
    Returns the drawing attributes of the object.
*** handle-key()
    Takes a key press and if it means a player robot control from the user then it updates the robot appropriately.
*** --do-shoot()
    User is trying to fire.Currently this just causes a new bullet to be created but in the future it will consider
    the robot's current equipment,gun status etc.
*** handle-possible-hit()
    Check if we've been hit by an object.
*** is-alive()
    Check if robot has been destroyed.
*** shield()
    Returns the health of the robot.

** class Autopilot
    Enemy Robot controlled by the computer.
    Provides a means of doing an automated system test, although in future this could also be used to provide a demo mode.
    Derived from Robot object but controls the robot from the tick() method rather than keys.
    Contains the following functions:
*** --init--()
    Initialises the Enemy Robot co-ordinates,shape,play area,initial direction movement.
*** handle-key()
    Overide this to do nothing as the computer is in control.
*** tick(),-decide-leftright()
    Decides where to move,randomly.
*** -moveleft()
    To move left.
*** -moveright()
    To move right.

*** -drawing-attribs()
    Returns the drawing attributes of the Mine object.
*** explosion-duration()
    Returns the game time at which the explosion animation for the object ends.

* asteroid.py
  There are two variations of asteroids, small and large. As well as the obvious
size difference, large ones take more hits.Other than that they are identical.

** class Asteroid

** class SmallAsteroid
   Inherits Asteroid.
   Implements small version of the asteroid.

** class LargeAsteroid
   Inherits Asteroid.
   Implements large version of the asteroid.


* Advantages

These five files, each pertaining to a single objective, help in building a concrete organisational structure of the game.
One has to look into only one file for carrying out a specific operation,ranging from analyzing the game flow,implementing object methods to defining object properties.
This design of Game Programming makes it easy for a developer to conceptualize his game idea,divide his tasks and also helps other developers understand his code and work/modify it.

Hence,the game source code can be successfully re-used for a different GUI or for a different game idea.

* Miscelleneous
  The program control flows in the main function, and its implementation branches out to other files and the classes in them.
  The logic resides in the classes of the game objects.
  
* Extra features
  
1. Interactive GUI
2. More enhanced graphical representations of the Robot,the defuse codes,the Bomb.
3. Four highly engaging levels.
4. Ability of the Robot to be able to shoot bullets.
5. Extra obstacles in the form of Mines and Asteroids.
6. A special Enemy Robot which runs itself in an automated randomized fashion,adding a challenging aspect to the game level.
7. Time Limit, which adds to the challenges to be faced by the player.
